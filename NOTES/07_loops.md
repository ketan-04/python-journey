# Loops in Python

## What is a Loop?
A **loop** is used when we want to repeat a block of code multiple times.

Python has two main types of loops:
1. **for loop**
2. **while loop**

## 1. for Loop
Used when we know how many times we want to repeat.

```python
for i in range(5):
    print("Hello Python", i)
