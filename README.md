# 🐍 My Python Journey — Starting from Zero  

Hi! 👋 I’ve just started learning Python, and this repository will be my notebook to practice, explore, and improve.  
I’ll be organizing everything topic-wise so I can track my growth over time.

## 📚 Learning Plan
1. **Basics** — syntax, print, variables, loops  
2. **Data Structures** — lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries  
3. **OOP Concepts** — classes, objects, inheritance  
4. **Libraries** — numpy, pandas, matplotlib  
5. **Mini Projects** — applying what I learn  
6. **Major Projects** — real-world Python apps (later)

## 🌱 Current Focus
🔹 Learning the basics of Python  
🔹 Practicing small problems daily  
🔹 Uploading each concept in its own folder
